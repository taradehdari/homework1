# homework1: CSS Refactoring
The purpose of this project was to learn to refractor code.
This was my first time refactoring a code. We refractor code to make a code easier to read and understand for others. 
When I went in to refactor this code I went and looked for any duplications. 
I combined all the duplications on CSS by changing some of the wording on html.
Initially, I had trouble understanding how to refractor the code. 
I fist went and looked at the duplications on the css side, but no matter what I changed, I kept changing the site. 
Then, after the example we had in class, I realized that I had to go and fix the html side as well. 
I changed divisions to sections and asides accordingly, as well as changed some of the class names.  
After that I changed the CSS side by combining similar codes together. 
Last, I went in and added "alt=" for the images.
Once I did that, I was able to clean the code at the best of my ability without changing the website.
This homework initially gave me some complications but after asking for help, and some google searches, I found out how to refactor code.
